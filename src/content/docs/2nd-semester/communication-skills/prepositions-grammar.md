title: Prepositions Grammar
---

## Overview
Prepositions show relationships between nouns, pronouns, and other words in a sentence. They indicate location, time, direction, manner, and other relationships. Mastering prepositions is crucial for precise, natural-sounding English.

## Common Prepositional Errors

### 1. "Different from" vs "Different than"
**Correct:** "Different from"
- Right: "This book is different from that one"
- Right: "Your approach is different from mine"
- Wrong: "This is different than that"

**Exception:** "Different than" is acceptable when followed by a clause:
- Acceptable: "The result was different than what we expected"
- Better: "The result was different from what we expected"

### 2. "Type of" vs "Type of a"
**Correct:** "Type of" (no article)
- Right: "What type of car do you drive?"
- Right: "This type of music relaxes me"
- Wrong: "What type of a car do you drive?"

### 3. Ending Sentences with Prepositions
**Formal writing:** Avoid ending with prepositions
- Informal: "Where are you going to?"
- Formal: "Where are you going?"
- Informal: "What are you looking for?"
- Formal: "For what are you looking?" (though this sounds awkward)

**Modern approach:** It's often acceptable in casual speech and writing when avoiding it creates awkwardness.

## Preposition + Pronoun Rules

**Always use object pronouns after prepositions:**
- "between you and me" (not "between you and I")
- "for him and her" (not "for he and she")
- "with us" (not "with we")
- "to them" (not "to they")

**Common mistakes:**
- Wrong: "This is between you and I"
- Right: "This is between you and me"
- Wrong: "Come with my friend and I"
- Right: "Come with my friend and me"
